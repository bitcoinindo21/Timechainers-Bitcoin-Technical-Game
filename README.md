Hello, player! Welcome to the greatest mempool game ever played! 🔥

Timechainers is a Bitcoin board game packed with technical chaos, mempool drama, and fee-sniping strategy. Players don’t just move pieces across a board. They dive into the heart of Bitcoin and wrestle with transactions, sats, and address types like SegWit, Taproot, and Legacy while racing to score the highest points. 🌟

At the start of the game, every player chooses one out of four play focuses, shaping their entire strategy:

- Funding a Project focusing on pushing big transactions through the network as efficiently as possible.

- Consolidation focusing on reducing inputs and shrinking transaction size to save sats and space.

- RBF (Replace by Fee) focusing on leapfrogging others in the mempool by raising fees at the perfect moment.

- Income focusing on generating sats turn by turn to out-economy opponents and overpower the network with pure purchasing force.

A fourth optional mode for future expansions focusing on fresh challenges that twist the game even further.

During the game, the mempool grows, fees surge and drop, and everyone fights to get confirmed before the block fills up. Players choose whether to spend sats like a maniac or save every satoshi. They decide whether to go modern with SegWit and Taproot or stick to Legacy and pay the price. Every decision either tightens the lead or burns the scoreboard to the ground.

Timechainers teaches Bitcoin without turning into homework. You learn how mempools behave. You learn why fees matter. You learn why sats are precious. And the whole time you are too busy laughing, plotting, and sabotaging your friends to notice that you’re basically running a miniature Bitcoin network.

In Timechainers, the timechain never sleeps and the rivalry never stops. Only the smartest, greediest, or luckiest player becomes the ultimate chainer. ⛓️⏳
